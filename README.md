# Holy Media Queries, Batman!

Now we'll be using Flexbox OR Grid (whichever you prefer!) to change a holy grail layout into a responsive layout. Use whatever tools you like, as long as those tools include media queries!


### Setup

This is a fork-and-clone situation. Go do that thing!


### Basics

You have as resources:

1. A holy grail layout. Your desktop layout is done!
2. Screenshots in `assets` for a tablet layout and a mobile layout.


### Your Goal

It doesn't have to be _pixel-perfect_, but implement the following two layouts:

1. A mobile layout that takes effect if the screen is below 700 pixes wide.
2. A tablet layout that takes effect if the screen is bigger than the mobile layout but below 1100 pixels wide.

The goal here is to practice your media queries and either Flexbox or Grid.


### Good Luck!
